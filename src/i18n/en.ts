    "motivation-text": `"Becoming a surfing pro is not just about riding waves — it’s about
        discipline, balance, and endless hours in the water. You must learn to
        read the ocean, master your board, and build both physical and mental
        strength. With passion, persistence, and respect for the sea, every
        wipeout becomes a lesson and every wave brings you closer to mastery."`,
    "heading-wave": "The WAVE",
    "theory-wave": `"To surf, you need to understand how a wave works: Line-up – the area
          where surfers wait for waves. Peak – the first part of the wave that
          breaks. Face – the clean, unbroken surface of the wave you ride.
          Whitewater – the foamy part after the wave breaks. Goal: catch the
          wave before it breaks, on the clean face."`,
    "heading-gear": "The Surfboard & Gear",
    "theory-gear": `"Softboard (foamie) – soft, stable beginner board. Longboard – big and
          stable, easy to catch waves. Shortboard – smaller, more maneuverable,
          but harder for beginners. Leash – cord attaching the board to your
          ankle. Wax – applied on the deck to avoid slipping."`,
    "heading-position": "Positiom in the water",
    "theory-position": `"Lie in the center of the board (not too far forward or back). Look
          toward the horizon, not down. Paddle with long, steady strokes to get
          past the breaking waves."`,
    "heading-safety": "Safety",
    "theory-safety": `"Surf where there are lifeguards or instructors. Learn about currents,
          tides, and depth before entering. Don’t attempt big waves too soon. If
          you fall, protect your head and surface calmly."`,

    // card1_text:
    //   "A strong, but not overpowering, outgoing tidal current can be ideal for surfing, especially when combined with offshore winds that groom the wave surface. Surfers should also look for specific wave sizes (1-2 feet for beginners, 2-4 feet for intermediates) and a favorable tide that helps create bigger, faster waves without making the spot too shallow.",

After a surfing session, many people experience a sense of euphoria and relaxation, often referred to as the 'surfing high.' This feeling is attributed to the release of endorphins, which are natural mood boosters. Additionally, being in the ocean and connecting with nature can help reduce stress and promote a sense of well-being. The combination of physical activity, fresh air, and the rhythmic sound of the waves can create a calming effect, leaving surfers feeling rejuvenated and refreshed.",
